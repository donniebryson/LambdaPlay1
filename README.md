# Lambda Play #1
Novice Playing with Lambda Version 1
## No Claim of Originality or Accuracy
I am making no claim of originality. Portions of code and setup steps have been freely copied from blogs and the AWS documentation. I also am making no claim of accuracy. This is my first lambda task to do something useful after attending a workshop and watching a few videos. So, if you have never make a lampda function in AWS and you use this as your model, you are using a model from someone with about six hours more experience as you. Beware!

This minimal task checks if my ministry website, gospelmailbox.org, is up and running. If it is up then it sends me an e-mail that says it is good. If it is down then it sends me an email that the website is down. It is using the AWS built-in cron and the AWS email service (SES).

See the WIKI for more information.
