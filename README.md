# Lambda Play #1
Novice Playing with Lambda Version 1
## No Claim of Originality or Accuracy
I am making no claim of originality. Portions of code and setup steps have been freely copied from blogs and the AWS documentation. I also am making no claim of accuracy. This is my first lambda task to do something useful after attending a workshop and watching a few videos. So, if you have never make a lampda function in AWS and you use this as your model, you are using a model from someone with about six hours more experience as you. Beware!
